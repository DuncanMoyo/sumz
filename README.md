# Sumz

Welcome to Sumz! This project is an article summarizer that takes an online article and summarizes it. It also provides a history of links that have been summarized. The project is hosted at [https://647d4c0caf2e9e162c6f1c1b--gregarious-cannoli-cffcbf.netlify.app/](https://app.netlify.com/).
